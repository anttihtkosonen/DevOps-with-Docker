For this assignment I created an environment for the python3 environment, with data-analysis tools. I based it on the debian image and added the following tools and libraries 

-Python 3
-Pip for installing python modules
-build-essential, libssl-dev, libffi-dev and python-dev -libraries
-numpy, scipy, matplotlib, ipython, jupyter, pandas, sympy and nos -tools
-wget and curl for operations online
-git for version control
-heroku for deployment
-even though no editor was required, I also added vim, since it is useful to have some kind of editor available

To run the application, execute the following command, which starts the command line of the container:
docker run -it anttikosonen/exercise-1.17

The container is available at:
https://cloud.docker.com/repository/registry-1.docker.io/anttikosonen/exercise-1.17

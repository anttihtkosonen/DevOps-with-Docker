I used the dockerfile from exercise 1.17. Size before optimization was 1.22BG

For size optimization I changed the base to be node:alpine instead of Debian. I installed the apk-packages with
the --no-cache flag to save space, and also most packages with --virtual .build-deps, so that after installing
the pip-packages they are deleted. Size after optimization was 832 MB

Changing from Debian to Alpine was not that simple - many additional packages needed to be installed, which
were installed by default with Debian.

For security I added a normal user, and the docker is started as that user by default.
